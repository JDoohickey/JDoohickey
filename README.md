📈 Engineering Mindset in Code
python
# Example: Process optimization meets programming
def optimize_workflow(process_steps, constraints):
    """
    Apply industrial engineering principles to software workflows
    """
    # Time-motion analysis adapted to code efficiency
    bottlenecks = identify_bottlenecks(process_steps)
    
    # Lean principles for codebase management
    optimized_steps = apply_lean_principles(bottlenecks)
    
    # Six Sigma for quality assurance
    validated_process = six_sigma_validation(optimized_steps)
